I am Sebastian, a fourth-semester student of 'Computer Science & Digital Communications' at the University Of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna, majoring in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science and IT Security. Currently I am working on a Blockchain project, a decentralized application to be specific, which will store smart contracts that automatically run when predetermined conditions are met. I really enjoy making beats, which I upload on my beatstore and YouTube channel.
